# Serial_Processing_IntelliJ
Collection of classes for run time configuring of comm ports in Java with use case example.
<BR> 
Same project as [Serial_Processing](https://github.com/myupctoys/Serial_Processing) but using Java with IntelliJ.<BR>
<BR>
This has been done to help users migrate to a JAVA ide when coming from the Processing IDE. New users will quickly realize the benefits of auto-complete, context help, guidance and the plethora of other tools an IDE brings to the table whilst still have all the simplicity of Processing.<BR><BR>
Project works when launched from IntelliJ 2021.2 community edition, JDK 1.8.0_231 W10 64 bit, but need to try and generate a runnable artifact for the example. May also need to pare back some of the included JARs and make sure there aren't licence conflicts. Intention in including jar libs is to get the application running out of the box, not having to rely on user adding libs.<BR><BR>
