# Serial_Processing_IntelliJ
Same project as [Serial_Processing](https://github.com/myupctoys/Serial_Processing) but using Java with IntelliJ.<BR><BR>
  
Needs Testing.<BR><BR> 

Running works when launched from IntelliJ community edition, JDK 1.8.0_231 but need to try and generate a runnable artifact for the example. May also need to pare back some of the included JARs and make sure there aren't licence conflicts. Intention in including jar libs is to get the application running out of the box, no having to rely on user adding libs.
